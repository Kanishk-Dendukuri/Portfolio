# Portfolio

Hey there! My name is Kanishk Dendukuri and this is my portfolio. Below you will see some highlights of my projects. I was first exposed to programming when I was in middle school in 2017, in which I made two player scratch games. In 10th grade, I took AP Computer Science A, in which I learned alot of java. In 2020, as a junior, I took iOS Development and developed several games. In 12th grade, 2022, I took Advanced iOS App Development to learn more advanced game development and am working on a game with my friends.


# Scratch

I first started learing programming with a simple two player car racing game called [CarRace](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/163303345/) where players race around a small track to get to the finish line first. If a player goes outside the track they get reset back to the start.

After getting used to scrtach I decided to make a two player coop pacman game named [pac man-10](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/164566851/) where a player can choose between single player and coop more with the goal of eating all the green dots before the enimies kill you. It even has multiple levels.

# Java

After learning java for almost 4 months, my friends and I decided to develop a game using java awt and jpanel. We decided to make a shooting game called [GETAWAY](https://github.com/EPHS-Java-2020/final-post-ap-project-2020-team-mario/) where players run and dodge bullets and obstacles and try to make it into the getaway car. Laser shooting desert rangers and awfully fast chickens guest star.



# iOS App Development

I started the class with no prior knowledge in Sw![Simulator Screen Shot - iPhone 8 Plus - 2021-02-24 at 12 34 38](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/65775557/161875524-208fd4b7-4965-4f86-b63f-d1aa87c3a2a6.png)
ift, but I did have experience with developing in other languages such as c++, python, and java. So I decided to make a simple game. In the procces of making the game I learned a lot about spriteKit. I incorperated a highscore that stores on the devide and even had music. [Astroid Dodge](https://github.com/kanthecalc/SpaceKan)
