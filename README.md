# Portfolio

Hey there! My name is Kanishk Dendukuri and this is my github portfolio. Below you will see some highlights of my projects. I was first exposed to programming was during middle school in 2017, in which I made two player scratch games. In 10th grade, I took AP Computer Science A, in which I learned alot about non block code with java. In 2020, as a junior, I took iOS Development and developed several games. In 12th grade I took Advanced iOS App Development to learn more advanced game development and am working on a game with my friends.


# Java
After learning java for almost 4 months, I decided to try my skills by developing a game using java awt and jpanel. Me and a small team developed a shooting game called GETAWAY where players run and dodge bullets and obstacles and try to make it into the getaway car. Laser shooting desert rangers and awfully fast chickens guest star.
