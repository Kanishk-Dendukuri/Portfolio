# Portfolio

Hey there! My name is Kanishk Dendukuri and this is my portfolio. Below you will see some highlights of my projects. I was first exposed to programming when I was in middle school in 2017, in which I made two player scratch games. In 10th grade, I took AP Computer Science A, in which I learned alot of java. In 2020, as a junior, I took iOS Development and developed several games. In 12th grade, 2022, I am taking Advanced iOS App Development to learn more advanced game development and am working on a game with my friends.


# Scratch

I first started learing programming with a simple two player car racing game called [CarRace](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/163303345/) where players race around a small track to get to the finish line first. If a player goes outside the track they get reset back to the start.

After getting used to scrtach I decided to make a two player coop pacman game named [pac man-10](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/164566851/) where a player can choose between single player and coop more with the goal of eating all the green dots before the enimies kill you. It even has multiple levels.

# Java

After learning java for almost 4 months, my friends and I decided to develop a game using java awt and jpanel. We decided to make a shooting game called [GETAWAY](https://github.com/EPHS-Java-2020/final-post-ap-project-2020-team-mario/) where players run and dodge bullets and obstacles and try to make it into the getaway car. Laser shooting desert rangers and awfully fast chickens guest star.



# iOS App Development

I started the class with no prior knowledge in Swift, but I did have experience with developing in other languages such as c++, python, and java. So I decided to make a simple game. In the procces of making the game I learned a lot about spriteKit. I incorperated a highscore that stores on the devide and even had music. [Astroid Dodge](https://github.com/kanthecalc/SpaceKan)

After learning some basic spritekit I decided to work on a level based platformer with a couple of my friends. The game is called [Astro Portal](https://github.com/EPHS-iOS/Astro-Portal). Astro Portal is a platformer on the iOS app store. It is avaiable for iPhone, iPad, and has keyboard control support for macs with Apple Silicon chips. While making the game I learned how design levels in such a way that it maximizes the game mechanics. We also released two additional updates after the initial release on the App Store where we fixed bugs, reworked movement mechinacs to be more user-friendly, added a personal best system, and a launch trailer.

The game I am working on now is called [Knight](https://github.com/EPHS-iOS/knight) (till we come up with a better name). Knight is going to be a metroidvania where the player has to explore the map to find abilities to be able to reach other parts of the map. I am excited to design the map and make exciting boss fights.
