Portfolio
Introduction
Hey there! My name is Sarthak Agrawal you're currently reading my github portfolio. Below you will see some highlights of my projects. I was first exposed to programming as a freshman in highschool in the year 2018. My knowledge mainly extended to MIT APP Inventor and some java basics. As a sophomore, my java knowledge grew. At the end of my sophomore year, I was proficient in java and several libraries. Over the covid summer, I learned python and javascript and was able to build a few projects described here. In 2020, as a junior, I took iOS Development and developed several games and projects listed below as well.

I have a personal website with some more information about projects as well.

Java
After learning java for almost 4 months, I decided to try my skills by developing a game using java awt and jpanel. Me and a small team developed a shooting game called GETAWAY where players run and dodge bullets and obstacles and try to make it into the getaway car. Laser shooting desert rangers and awfully fast chickens guest star.

Web Development
During the summer of covid, I began to try my hand at python. I became proficient in the language; building several complex projects. The first website I built was through a python framework called Django. This website simply offered a way for students to ask and answer I was able to deploy the code to heroku and use the postgresql database they provided called forumappephs. Link to code.

After school started, I assembled a small team to work on a full website for students to ask questions and get answers. The website was to be split into two parts, for frontend and backend. The frontend is a react js single page application that makes API calls to a REST API backend built using the python framework Django.

The website is currently in development, this will be updated!
iOS Development
I started the iOS Development class with no experience in developing in Swift, but I did have experience with developing in other languages such as javascript, python, and java. The first project I started was just a simple click game where players click on a button to earn money. The amount of money gained everytime after click the button can be increased by paying a cost to upgrade the amount of money made.

The next thing I worked was just a small step up: working on a dodge game. Players in this game must try to dodge falling spikes try to survive as long as possible.

The next project I worked on was a HUGE step up! Starting from a base spritekit project, me along with a small team built a full game where players must avoid becoming infected; the game is called Apocalypse Survivor. Zombies spawn from all sides, and players must avoid the zombies by shooting them, outmanuavering, and even using abilities.
